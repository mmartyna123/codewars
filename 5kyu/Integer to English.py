# For a given positive integer convert it into its English representation. All words are lower case and are separated with one space. No trailing spaces are allowed.

# To keep it simple, hyphens and the writing of the word 'and' both aren't enforced. (But if you are looking for some extra challenge, such an output will pass the tests.)

# int_to_english(25161045656) == 'twenty five billion one hundred sixty one million forty five thousand six hundred fifty six'
